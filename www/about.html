		<h1>Hello!</h1>
		<p>
		My name's Peter, last name in the title. 
		I am currently a Senior student at Florida Polytechnic University studying Computer Engineering. 
		This website is/was a project, and so are the subprojects. 
		Some parts are still work in progress outside of the website project project. 
		As many other students, I am robbed of an opportunity to graduate on time due to a lack of an internship.
		<br>
		Please peruse my resume below. No for-profit unpaid internships please. Non-profits OK.
